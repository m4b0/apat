### Another personalized aggregator tool

Information aggregators are tools which pull in information from multiple sources, and consolidate that information into a smaller and more easily digested number of streams.

There are many such information aggregators as a concept, and we use them all the time without thinking – things in the physical world like the Encyclopedia, the newspaper, the library, and so on. In the digital world we also found their equivalents.

Every person has different information needs and new tools are required. 

Over the past 15 years, we’ve seen an explosion in the number of different sources of information. Furthermore, much of that information has been pretty heterogeneous. The build out of  the “internet of things” will lead to the doubling of knowledge every 12 hours.

Content aggregator websites don’t produce their own content. Instead, they collect content from other websites around the Internet and “aggregate” it into one easy-to-find location.

Typically an aggregator is a system of subprograms:
* Connector, this organize and connect to sources of information
* Grabber, this searches and grabs all of the content that is needed to be summarized
* Summarization- this is typically done through queries to the db and can be adjusted based on user preferences
* View - this formats the information for what the user would like to see and can respond to feedback on the user's likes or dislikes of the item suggested.
